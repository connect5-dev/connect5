            <h1>Cancer Connect - Adolescent or Young Adult Cancer CARE App</h1>
            <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
            <p>The 13thirty CARE App is a web application designed for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) that have fought or are currently fighting cancer. The goal of the app is to connect AYAs to service providers, both in and out of healthcare, that have provided solid service and undergone 13thirtyâ€™s specialized training. The application exists in three parts: a forum for AYAs to connect to each other and discuss shared experiences, a learning tool for service providers to get certified by 13thirty, and a searching tool for AYAs to find service providers based on the service they provide. Providers will be rated by users, and other users will be able to view these ratings in order to make informed decisions about the services they use.</p>
